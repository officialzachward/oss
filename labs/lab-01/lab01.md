# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

# Creating and Setting Up a Github account
I was able to create my account named *officialzachward* and forked the template
repostory. Some information about me is stored in [here](../../index.md)

I was also able to join the discord #general channel and posted a greeting
under the name *zach_*!

# Reading assignments

I have read the 10 criteria of Open Source Definition and understand why they are important. Further, I have
read Eric Raymond's article, "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" and understand why his points
are important.
**My Two Suggestions for Answering a Question in a Helpful way (from past experience) are:**
* Specify when you aren't completely sure about a solution. It can be helpful when you have a hack or workaround for something, but it can
also sabotage someone if he or she doesn't know its just a hack.
* Don't be afraid to dive into your thinking process when addressing big problems or multi-part questions. Many times, people skip the small steps
when they explain a solution to someone, but its those small steps that allow the other to discern your thinking process.  

I have also read chapter 3 of Free Culture.

**Takeaways from Chapter 3:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading Chapter 3 of Free Culture, I am nothing but shocked.
I didn't realize how common it was for a student, simply tinkering
with exciting technology, to be sued for everything he or she has.
Jesse Jordan, who was merely "tinkering with a Google-like technology at a university" (Lessig), making no money, suffered extreme consequences. Not only did Jesse have to give up his entire savings, but having an innovative personality like he had was also discouraged after this lawsuit. Personally, I do not think Jesse did anything wrong, and RIAA was certainly being predatory with this lawsuit. Further, RIAA's original request for damages was far larger than it should have been, and considering Jesse did not make any money off of what he did, he should not have had to give any money up. To be honest, after reading this chapter, I'm not entirely sure how Jesse violated any copyright laws and how he was accused of piracy, especially given that he wasn't publicly advertising his service. I am also curious how Jesse caught the RIAA's attention with what he was doing. All in all, I think this lawsuit is a tragedy and speaks volumes about how big corporations will exploit potentially lawsuit opportunities whenever possible.

# Getting Familiar with Linux
I have read the first chapter of *Beautiful Code* about the development and implementation of
a very simple grep.

I have familiarized myself with the directory structure and 
have installed tree. I have also performed *man tree*.
The relevant screenshots are attached below:
