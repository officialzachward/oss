# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

# Creating and Setting Up a Github account
I was able to create my account named *officialzachward* and forked the template
repostory. Some information about me is stored in [here](../../index.md)

I was also able to join the discord #general channel and posted a greeting
under the name *zach_*!

# Reading assignments - make sure to reflect on these in a lab1.md file in your repository

Please read the 10 criteria of Open Source Definition and understand why they are important.
Please read Eric Raymond's article Smart Questions How to ask the question The Smart Way .
**Do you have more suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way (from your past experience)?
List at least two.**
* Specify when you aren't completely sure about a solution. It can be helpful when you have a hack or workaround for something, but it can
also sabotage someone if he or she doesn't know its just a hack.
Please read chapter 3 of Free Culture

Write a short paragraph ( 8 to 10 sentences) of what you got out of reading that chapter.
Read the first chapter in Beautiful Code about the development and implementation (in C) of a very simple grep

You don't need to record anything here on the reading, but it will help you with the exercises on grep, egrep, and regex.
Linux

Boot linux (Ubuntu) through a USB, dual boot, or WSL

Get familiar with the directory structure.
Practice with ls, cd, mkdir, chmod commands - when in doubt search the web to find the answer.
Practice with grep, egrep commands

Look at the manual (man grep) to see how to use these commands.
Install tree and get the directory structure.

On linux: sudo apt-get install tree, or use the Ubuntu software install
on OSX: brew install tree
man tree
For Ubuntu versions 18.04 and greater:
sudo snap install tree
tree --help
On WSL, it looks like it is already available https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tree
Take a screenshot and add to lab01.md
Regex

In your Foundations of Computer Science class you learned about Regular expressions. (If you have not taken Foundations of Computer Science class, please talk to the instructor for an explanation). Please do the practice problems given here.

To get full credit, do at least 7 problems.
Take a screenshot and add to lab01.md
Go through the tutorials here to practice regex crosswords, then try a few problems.

Do at least four problems on beginner level here.
Take a screenshot and add to lab01.md
(Optional But Recommended) Do problem 11 in adventofcode 2015 (You may use regular expression)

Play with Snap or Blockly

Create some thing using Snap or solve this using blockly
Add documentation (screenshots) of your accomplishments to lab1.md
Reflection

Pick an Open Source Project that might be interesting to evaluate
Start thinking/finding a problem/project that interests you
Add a paragraph on how you are doing this activity to lab01.md
Check out http://aosabook.org/en/index.html for a list of a number of open source projects and for a discussion of the architectures they use.
