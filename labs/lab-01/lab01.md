# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

# Creating and Setting Up a Github account
I was able to create my account named *officialzachward* and forked the template
repostory. Some information about me is stored in [here](../../index.md)

I was also able to join the discord #general channel and posted a greeting
under the name *zach_*!

# Reading assignments

I have read the 10 criteria of Open Source Definition and understand why they are important. Further, I have
read Eric Raymond's article, "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" and understand why his points
are important.
**My Two Suggestions for Answering a Question in a Helpful way (from past experience) are:**
* Specify when you aren't completely sure about a solution. It can be helpful when you have a hack or workaround for something, but it can
also sabotage someone if he or she doesn't know its just a hack.
* Don't be afraid to dive into your thinking process when addressing big problems or multi-part questions. Many times, people skip the small steps
when they explain a solution to someone, but its those small steps that allow the other to discern your thinking process.  

I have also read chapter 3 of Free Culture.

**Takeaways from Chapter 3:**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading Chapter 3 of Free Culture, I am nothing but shocked.
I didn't realize how common it was for a student, simply tinkering
with exciting technology, to be sued for everything he or she has.
Jesse Jordan, who was merely "tinkering with a Google-like technology at a university" (Lessig), making no money, suffered extreme consequences. Not only did Jesse have to give up his entire savings, but having an innovative personality like he had was also discouraged after this lawsuit. Personally, I do not think Jesse did anything wrong, and RIAA was certainly being predatory with this lawsuit. Further, RIAA's original request for damages was far larger than it should have been, and considering Jesse did not make any money off of what he did, he should not have had to give any money up. To be honest, after reading this chapter, I'm not entirely sure how Jesse violated any copyright laws and how he was accused of piracy, especially given that he wasn't publicly advertising his service. I am also curious how Jesse caught the RIAA's attention with what he was doing. All in all, I think this lawsuit is a tragedy and speaks volumes about how big corporations will exploit potentially lawsuit opportunities whenever possible.

# Getting Familiar with Linux
I have read the first chapter of *Beautiful Code* about the development and implementation of
a very simple grep.

I have familiarized myself with the directory structure and 
have installed tree. I have also performed *man tree*.
The relevant screenshots are attached below:

# Regex Practice Problems

To get full credit, do at least 7 problems.
Take a screenshot and add to lab01.md
Go through the tutorials here to practice regex crosswords, then try a few problems.

Do at least four problems on beginner level here.
Take a screenshot and add to lab01.md
(Optional But Recommended) Do problem 11 in adventofcode 2015 (You may use regular expression)

# Play with Snap or Blockly

Create some thing using Snap or solve this using blockly
Add documentation (screenshots) of your accomplishments to lab1.md
Reflection

# Pick an Open Source Project that might be interesting to evaluate
Start thinking/finding a problem/project that interests you
Add a paragraph on how you are doing this activity to lab01.md
Check out http://aosabook.org/en/index.html for a list of a number of open source projects and for a discussion of the architectures they use.
