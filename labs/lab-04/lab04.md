# Lab 04 - Licensing

License for this lab: https://github.com/officialzachward/oss/blob/master/labs/lab-04/LICENSE.md  
I also read the [four criteria for Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

**Why is it important to choose a License?**  
It is very important to choose a specific License when starting an open source project as the license
allows users to use, modify and/or share source code or design under defined terms and conditions. Some project
owners would prefer to have their code cited when it is used in other products or ideas, and this is something,
for example, that could be specified in a license. Finally, code cannot be officially open source without
some sort of license.  

**Why I am not using source code of a project without a license**  
Any code that doesn’t explicitly have a license specified is considered “all rights reserved” by the author (this is standard copyright law in the United States).  
In other words, you don’t have any legal right to use, reproduce, distribute, or otherwise use the code without the consent of the author. Thus, if I ever come across
source code with no license, I will not be using it.  

**Failure to follow the Open System Model**  
I agree with the claims made by *Failure to follow the Open System Model*. It is certainly the case that when there are open (obvious)
communication standards, open source projects can more easily flourish. Gopher deviated from many other standards as well which
led to Gopher's fall.

**Why SailfishOS is not open source (Justification)**  
Given the circumstances, it definitely makes the most sense for SailfishOS to be mostly proprietary; the main usage  
for the operating system is for a flagship phone, Jolla, and it would make the most sense to keep the phones operating
system from being replicated in another rival's phone. All in all, the amount of phones that use this OS, viewable [here](https://jolla-devices.com/sailfish_devices/),  
is limited. The developers of SailfishOS likely want to keep their UX unique as that was a large selling point of the software.
